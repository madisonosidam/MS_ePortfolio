<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<img src="images/Portfolio Picture.jpg" alt="Photo of Madison Smith" id="profile-photo" width="600" height="600" style="vertical-align: text-top; float: right">
<p>Hey there! I’m Madison Smith, an Interior Design major at the University of Alabama and a Drafting & Design major at Wallace Community College Selma. I’m passionate
about how creativity and structure come together to shape spaces, from stylish interiors to practical layouts.

When I’m not working on design projects or classwork, I love gaming (Call of Duty is my favorite), getting lost in a good book, or just relaxing and recharging.

This ePortfolio is a little glimpse into my world, my education, my passions, and the work I’m proud of. I’m excited to share it with you!</p>
